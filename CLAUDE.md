- Do TDD always, even for bugs, test that fails first
- Create tests first!
- Simpler is better
- Modularity is even better
- Data driven, we love json
- Classless css is better that class based css
- Run the tests before and after your changes
- TODOs are a nice way to leave notes for features that are not finished
- Old files must be removed ASAP, if they can't be removed, ask
- Compact sooner, at 10% left to be safe
- Self reflect, review your work, you're not perfect
- Ask questions if in doubt
- Use tools!
