# Equipment System Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Backend - Warband Stash & Transactions (TDD)
**Status:** Core functionality complete, integration tests need fixes

#### Models
- ✅ **Warband.cs** - Added stash support
  - `List<Equipment> Stash` property for warband equipment storage
  - `int StashValue` - calculates total value of stash equipment
  - `bool CanAfford(int cost)` - checks if warband has enough gold
  - `int TotalValue` - updated to include gold + character equipment + stash equipment

#### Tests - Model Level
- ✅ **WarbandStashTests.cs** (7/7 passing)
  - Warband should have empty stash by default
  - Add/remove equipment to/from stash
  - Total value includes stash equipment
  - Stash value calculation
  - CanAfford validation

#### Services
- ✅ **IGameStateService.cs** - Added 4 new methods:
  - `Task BuyEquipmentAsync(warbandId, equipmentId, equipmentType)`
  - `Task SellEquipmentAsync(warbandId, equipmentId)`
  - `Task TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync(warbandId, characterId, equipmentId)`
  - `Task TransferEquipmentToStashAsync(warbandId, characterId, equipmentId)`

- ✅ **GameStateService.cs** - Implementation complete:
  - `BuyEquipmentAsync()` - Loads equipment from EquipmentService, validates gold, deducts cost, adds to stash
  - `SellEquipmentAsync()` - Removes from stash, adds gold back
  - `TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync()` - Validates slots, moves from stash to character
  - `TransferEquipmentToStashAsync()` - Moves from character to stash

#### Tests - Service Level
- ✅ **GameStateServiceTests.cs** - Buy/Sell/Transfer tests (8/8 passing)
  - ✅ Sell equipment removes from stash and adds gold
  - ✅ Sell throws when equipment not found
  - ✅ Transfer to character moves from stash
  - ✅ Transfer to character throws when not enough slots
  - ✅ Transfer to stash moves from character
  - ✅ Transfer to stash throws when equipment not found
  - ✅ Buy equipment adds to stash and deducts gold
  - ✅ Buy throws when insufficient gold

#### Data
- ✅ **All JSON equipment files have icons** (56 items in last-war + all 28-psalms + all end-times)
  - weapons.json (all 3 variants)
  - armor.json (all 3 variants)
  - equipment.json (all 3 variants)

#### Build Status
- ✅ **Solution builds successfully** - 0 warnings, 0 errors
- ✅ **42/49 GameStateService tests passing** (86% pass rate)
  - 7 failing tests are name generation related (not equipment-related)
  - All equipment tests passing (8/8)

## ❌ MISSING / TODO

### Phase 2: Backend - Equipment Validation (TDD)
**Status:** Not started

#### Tests Needed
- [ ] **EquipmentValidationTests.cs** - Create comprehensive validation tests
  - Armor limits (only 1 armor piece at a time)
  - Tech level compatibility (past/future weapons based on game variant)
  - Stat requirements from JSON (e.g., "Must have 2+ Strength")
  - Class restrictions (e.g., spellcasters can't wear heavy armor)
  - Special restrictions from effects/restrictions arrays in JSON

#### Implementation Needed
- [ ] **EquipmentValidator.cs** - Create validator service with rules:
  ```csharp
  - bool CanEquipArmor(Character character, Armor armor)
  - bool MeetsStatRequirements(Character character, Equipment equipment)
  - bool MeetsTechLevelRequirements(string gameVariant, Equipment equipment)
  - bool MeetsClassRestrictions(Character character, Equipment equipment)
  - string? ValidateEquipment(Character character, Equipment equipment)
  ```

- [ ] **GameStateService.cs** - Integrate validation:
  - Update `AddEquipmentToCharacterAsync()` to use validator
  - Update `TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync()` to use validator
  - Update `CanCharacterEquip()` to use validator

---

### Phase 3: Frontend - Equipment Components
**Status:** Not started

#### Components Needed
- [ ] **EquipmentCard.razor** - Display single equipment item
  - Show icon, name, stats (damage, armor value, etc.)
  - Show properties as badges
  - Show cost with gold icon
  - Show slots usage
  - Clickable for details

- [ ] **EquipmentList.razor** - Grid/list view of multiple equipment items
  - Filter by type (weapons, armor, items)
  - Filter by tech level (past, future)
  - Sort by cost, name, slots
  - Search by name
  - Uses EquipmentCard for each item

- [ ] **EquipmentSelector.razor** - Modal to browse and select equipment
  - Similar to InfoSelector component
  - Tabs for weapons/armor/items
  - Shows available equipment from EquipmentService
  - Displays gold cost
  - Handles selection callback

---

### Phase 4: Frontend - Character Equipment Panel
**Status:** Not started

#### Updates Needed
- [ ] **CharacterEdit.razor** - Add equipment section
  - Show current equipped items in a grid
  - Display slot usage indicator (e.g., "3/5 slots used")
  - "Add Equipment" button that opens EquipmentSelector
  - Each equipped item has "Remove" button
  - Show effective stats with equipment bonuses (TODO in Character.cs line 28)
  - Integration with TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync/TransferEquipmentToStashAsync

---

### Phase 5: Frontend - Warband Stash & Shop
**Status:** Not started

#### Components Needed
- [ ] **WarbandStash.razor** - Stash management page/modal
  - Display all equipment in warband stash using EquipmentList
  - Show gold balance prominently
  - "Buy Equipment" button to open shop
  - Each stash item has:
    - "Assign to Character" button (opens character selector)
    - "Sell" button with confirmation
  - Filter and search capabilities

- [ ] **EquipmentShop.razor** - Purchase interface
  - Browse all available equipment by game variant
  - Tabs for weapons/armor/items
  - Filter by tech level, cost range
  - Shows gold balance and cost
  - "Purchase" button with gold validation
  - Adds to warband stash on purchase
  - Uses EquipmentList or EquipmentSelector component

- [ ] **WarbandManagement.razor** - Add navigation
  - Add "Manage Equipment" or "Stash" button in warband header
  - Links to WarbandStash page/modal

---

### Phase 6: UI Polish - Hide Stats
**Status:** Not started

#### Updates Needed
- [ ] **WarbandManagement.razor** or **StatsDisplay.razor**
  - Remove "Total Value" from warband stats display
  - Remove "Members" count from warband stats display
  - These stats exist in the model but shouldn't be shown in the UI

---

### Phase 7: Testing & Fixes
**Status:** Complete

#### Test Fixes Applied
- ✅ **GameStateServiceTests.cs** - Fixed all equipment integration tests
  - Added mock for IEmbeddedResourceService with test equipment data
  - Created SetupMockEquipmentData() helper method
  - All 8 Buy/Sell/Transfer tests now passing
  - Equipment loading works correctly via mocked resource service

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Complete equipment flow test:
  1. Buy equipment → verify in stash, gold deducted
  2. Transfer stash → character, verify slots used
  3. Remove character → stash, verify back in stash
  4. Sell stash → gold, verify gold added
- [ ] Test validation rules work correctly
- [ ] Test tech level restrictions
- [ ] Test armor limits (only 1 armor)
- [ ] Test stat requirements

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Equipment Flow
```
Shop (JSON data)
  ↓ BuyEquipmentAsync()
Warband Stash (List<Equipment>)
  ↓ TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync()
Character Equipment (List<Equipment>)
  ↓ TransferEquipmentToStashAsync()
Warband Stash
  ↓ SellEquipmentAsync()
Gold (int)
```

### Services
- **EquipmentService** - Loads equipment from JSON, caches per game variant
- **EquipmentValidator** - (TODO) Validates equipment rules
- **GameStateService** - Orchestrates all operations, manages state, persists changes

### Data Models
- **Weapon** (ISelectableItem) - Damage, Properties, Stat, Cost, Slots, TechLevel
- **Armor** (ISelectableItem) - ArmorValue, Special, Effects, Restrictions
- **Item** (ISelectableItem) - Effect, Type (item/ammo), Shots
- **Equipment** (Character model) - Unified model for equipped items
