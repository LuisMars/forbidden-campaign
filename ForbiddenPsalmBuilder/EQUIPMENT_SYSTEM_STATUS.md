**Status:** Complete and tested (54/54 tests passing)
**Commit:** `1626046` - feat: Complete equipment system with trader-based economy
**Date:** 2025-09-30

---

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Backend - Warband Stash & Transactions (TDD)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All tests passing

#### Models
- ✅ **Warband.cs** - Added stash support
  - `List<Equipment> Stash` property for warband equipment storage
  - `int StashValue` - calculates total value of stash equipment
  - `bool CanAfford(int cost)` - checks if warband has enough gold
  - `int TotalValue` - updated to include gold + character equipment + stash equipment

#### Tests - Model Level
- ✅ **WarbandStashTests.cs** (7/7 passing)
  - Warband should have empty stash by default
  - Add/remove equipment to/from stash
  - Total value includes stash equipment
  - Stash value calculation
  - CanAfford validation

#### Services
- ✅ **IGameStateService.cs** - Added 4 new methods with trader support:
  - `Task BuyEquipmentAsync(warbandId, equipmentId, equipmentType, traderId = null)`
  - `Task SellEquipmentAsync(warbandId, equipmentId, traderId = null)`
  - `Task TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync(warbandId, characterId, equipmentId)`
  - `Task TransferEquipmentToStashAsync(warbandId, characterId, equipmentId)`

- ✅ **GameStateService.cs** - Implementation complete with trader pricing:
  - `BuyEquipmentAsync()` - Loads equipment from EquipmentService, loads trader, calculates buy price, validates gold, deducts cost, adds to stash
  - `SellEquipmentAsync()` - Loads trader, calculates sell price, removes from stash, adds gold back
  - `TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync()` - Validates slots, moves from stash to character
  - `TransferEquipmentToStashAsync()` - Moves from character to stash
  - TraderService injected for trader pricing calculations

#### Tests - Service Level
- ✅ **GameStateServiceTests.cs** - Buy/Sell/Transfer tests (13/13 passing)
  - **Base operations (8 tests):**
    - ✅ Sell equipment removes from stash and adds gold
    - ✅ Sell throws when equipment not found
    - ✅ Transfer to character moves from stash
    - ✅ Transfer to character throws when not enough slots
    - ✅ Transfer to stash moves from character
    - ✅ Transfer to stash throws when equipment not found
    - ✅ Buy equipment adds to stash and deducts gold
    - ✅ Buy throws when insufficient gold
  - **Trader pricing tests (5 tests):**
    - ✅ Buy with trader uses trader buy price (50% rounded down)
    - ✅ Buy with The Merchant applies +1G modifier
    - ✅ Sell with trader uses trader sell price (100%)
    - ✅ Sell with The Merchant applies -1G modifier
    - ✅ Sell with The Merchant enforces 1G minimum price

#### Data
- ✅ **All JSON equipment files have icons** (56 items in last-war + all 28-psalms + all end-times)
  - weapons.json (all 3 variants)
  - armor.json (all 3 variants)
  - equipment.json (all 3 variants)

#### Build Status
- ✅ **Solution builds successfully** - 0 warnings, 0 errors
- ✅ **54/54 GameStateService tests passing** (100% pass rate)
  - All equipment tests passing (13/13, including trader pricing)
  - All name generation tests passing (11/11)

## ⚠️ DEFERRED / NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Features Deferred

#### 1. Effect Limits Validation
**Status:** SKIPPED - No clear game rules found

**Reason:** After searching all JSON data files, no explicit effect limit rules were found. This may be a house rule or not applicable to this game system. Can be added later if specific rules are identified.

#### 2. The Merchant Risk Mechanic
**Status:** DEFERRED - Complex feature requiring multiple components

**What it is:**
- When trading with The Merchant, roll D20 each visit
- On 1: Player gets "Lost Limb" injury on random character
- On second failure: Vriprix refuses to deal + The Merchant disappears

**Requirements:**
- Track risk failures per warband in Warband model
- Add RollTraderRisk() method to GameStateService
- Apply injury penalties to characters
- Block access to traders based on failures
- Create UI for rolling dice and displaying results
- Write comprehensive tests

**Why deferred:** This is a complete subsystem that should be its own feature. The core equipment economy is functional without it.

## ❌ TODO

### Phase 2: Backend - Equipment Validation (TDD)
**Status:** Complete

#### Tests Created
- ✅ **EquipmentValidatorTests.cs** - 12 comprehensive validation tests
  - ✅ Armor limits (only 1 body armor, accessories can stack)
  - ✅ Stat requirements validation
  - ✅ Slot availability checks
  - ✅ Multiple weapons/items allowed
  - ✅ Accessories (shields/helmets) can stack with body armor
  - ✅ Proper error messages returned

#### Implementation Complete
- ✅ **EquipmentValidator.cs** - Validator service with rules:
  - `bool CanEquipArmor(Character character, Equipment armor)` - Enforces 1 body armor limit, allows accessories
  - `bool MeetsStatRequirements(Character character, Equipment equipment, ...)` - Validates stat requirements
  - `ExtractStatRequirements(Armor armor)` - Parses restrictions from JSON
  - `string? ValidateEquipment(Character character, Equipment equipment, ...)` - Full validation with error messages

- ✅ **GameStateService.cs** - Validation integrated:
  - ✅ `AddEquipmentToCharacterAsync()` uses validator with stat requirements from armor restrictions
  - ✅ `TransferEquipmentToCharacterAsync()` uses validator
  - All equipment operations now validate before applying changes

#### Armor Type System
- ✅ **Added `armorType` field** to all armor JSON files:
  - `body` - Only 1 allowed per character (Light, Medium, Heavy, Full Plate, etc.)
  - `accessory` - Multiple allowed, stacks with body armor (Shield, Helmet, Boots, etc.)
  - `pet` - Pet-specific armor

#### Manual Testing Checklist
**Note:** Manual UI testing should be performed by user before production deployment:
- [ ] Complete equipment flow test:
  1. Buy equipment → verify in stash, gold deducted
  2. Transfer stash → character, verify slots used
  3. Remove character → stash, verify back in stash
  4. Sell stash → gold, verify gold added
- [ ] Test validation rules work correctly in UI
- [ ] Test armor limits (only 1 body armor, accessories can stack)
- [ ] Test trader pricing display
- [ ] Test search and filtering in EquipmentSelector

### Phase 8: Trader System Implementation
**Status:** Complete

#### Raw Data Verification
- ✅ Read all trader sections from raw data files (end-times.txt, 28-psalms.txt, last-war.txt)
- ✅ Verified actual game rules differ from original traders.json files
- ✅ Documented correct pricing:
  - Standard traders: Buy at 50% (rounded down), sell at 100%
  - The Merchant (end-times): Buy at 50% + 1 Gold, sell at 100% - 1 Gold (min 1)
  - Quartermaster (last-war): Buy at 50% (doesn't buy items that round to 0)
- ✅ Documented special mechanics:
  - The Merchant: Limited random inventory (3 weapons, 1 armor, 1 equipment, 1 relic)
  - The Merchant: Risk mechanic (D20, on 1 = Lost Limb injury)
  - Hogs Head Inn: Upgrade shop (50 Gold per upgrade), available from Chapter 2

#### Models Created

  - GetTraderByIdAsync()
  - GetTradersByChapterAsync() - filters by minimum chapter
  - CalculateBuyPrice() / CalculateSellPrice() wrapper methods

#### Data Files Updated
- ✅ **data/end-times/traders.json** - 3 traders:

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### 1. Manual UI Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)
Run the application and test the complete equipment flow:
```bash
dotnet run --project ForbiddenPsalmBuilder.Blazor
```
- Create a warband
- Add characters
- Open Stash modal
- Buy equipment from trader
- Assign equipment to characters
- Sell equipment back

### 2. LocalStorage Persistence (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Status:** SaveStateAsync/LoadStateAsync called but not implemented

**What to do:**
1. Install `Blazored.LocalStorage` NuGet package
2. Inject `ILocalStorageService` into GameStateService
3. Implement SaveStateAsync to serialize and save GlobalGameState
4. Implement LoadStateAsync to restore state on app startup
5. Write integration tests

**Files to modify:**
- `ForbiddenPsalmBuilder.Blazor/Program.cs` - Register LocalStorage service
- `ForbiddenPsalmBuilder.Core/Services/State/GameStateService.cs` - Implement save/load
- Create tests for state persistence

### 3. Campaign Progression Features (FUTURE)
- Injury system (required for The Merchant risk mechanic)
- Chapter tracking (for chapter-based trader filtering)
- Campaign milestones and rewards
- Character advancement (leveling, new feats)

### 4. Quality of Life Improvements (FUTURE)
- Undo/redo functionality
- Export warband to PDF
- Import/export warband data
- Dark mode theme
- Mobile-responsive improvements
