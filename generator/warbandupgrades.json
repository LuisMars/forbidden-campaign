Recruitment Poster
When recruiting a new warband member they now come equipped with one random
Weapon and Light Armor for free.

Beds 
You can expand your warband by one member per bed. You still only take five
warband members into each Scenario. You can buy up to five additional beds.
Each bed counts as one upgrade and costs 50 Gold.

Better Grub
You can give one member of your warband +1 HP. This upgrade can be purchased
once per warband member.

Ritual Circle 
You can attempt to resurrect a Dead member of your warband. Choose a surviving
member to perform the ritual. They make a Presence test. On success the resurrected
member replaces their Flaw with a new random Flaw. Failed rituals reduce the
performing modelâ€™s Toughness by 1. Fumbling the test kills the performing model.

Whittling Knife 
Your warband can make 5 Ammo or 1 Cannon Ball per Scenario.
