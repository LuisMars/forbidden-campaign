  The <b>fool prophet of a dead god</b>.
  A fool that hears only whispers. Fettered ideas. And for this, they are a <b>heretic</b>.
  A <b>cursed mortal</b> soul whose screams for a humanity lost remains little more than a choking cough; a whisper drowned beneath the black and trackless seas.
  A <b>dejected philosopher</b>, forlorn by society. Condemned as a sophist, mocked as a voice for a world without reason.

  A <b>faint ember</b>, a wickhead diminished. A lantern-headed slasher, denied their mastery of the dark. 
  A lawless <b>good-for-nothing prowler</b> from the fringes. A traitorous brigand that delights in the silent ecstasy of bitter wounds inflicted. Silver and gold bring their cold heart a sick comfort.
  A <b>dog-blooded mongrel</b> known as an earthbound; a foul and disloyal mutant unworthy of either lineage. They are used to getting by with nothing but the scraps. They have something to prove, violently if possible.
  A <b>local nobody</b>, notable only for their coattail chasing lust for clout. They steal stories from the dead braggarts who never return to {the Paunchy Swine|the Grey Galth Inn}. They must live any life but their own.
  A <b>red-shriven vicar</b> who has embraced the profane truth: all vestments, be it fine silk or one's own born skin, are abhorrent vanities. They defy such obscurement, seeking a flensed and gore-glistening truth.
  A <b>scorned hoarder</b> so often dismissed with the title of <b>roach king</b>. A filth-dweller, a mimic of a real person. They are a being who seeks foremost to hoard, to fester surrounded by their prizes.
  A <b>thief</b>, so common, so seldom pitiable. But this one stole from <b><i>Mikhael</b></i>, and now the Merchant wanders in search of a single coin so long ago spent; and the fool thief who dared take it.
  A <b>bastardborn hostage</b>, one of <b><i>King Fathmu IX</b></i> far-flung and forsaken seed which took root and caused him narry a thought for all their trouble. They have dark dreams of a birthright which will see them broken upon the wrack in a Schleswig oubliette.
  A <b>false basilisk</b>, a serpentine horror in mannish visage. A wretched usurper who seeks their own apotheosis at the End of All. Hunted by inquisitors, surely proof; they claim, that they are a threat to the "pretenders" <b>SHE</b> and <b>HE</b>.
  A <b>gilded wolf</b>, a rake whose hungry mind and way with words sees them a butcher without equal in the pursuit of highborn, noble prey. With a tragic air of well-versed poetics and court livery, they stalk the world in search of scions and sovereigns to slay.
  An <b>Heir to Südglans</b>, held in contempt and rancor by the remnant thrones of this dying world. Their dreams are haunted by the drowned screams of a nation rendered beneath sludge, beneath mud, beneath the waves. A pauper cursed by highborn blood.
  A <b>poison-priest</b>, an inheritor of a devastating art now lost beneath the tides. Their fingers are stained with ghastly pollens, spores, and blood. They wheeze, a hacking pain; a worrisome cost for this occupation. But still, they keep the faith.
  A <b>flesh-warped servant</b> of <b>the Mud Master of Targ-Dungel</b>, their body a rotted, malformed atrocity. Maggots breed in their wounds, under their tongue. They cackle, for all the world shall soon be little more than a bloated corpse; akin in apotheosis to their fetid godling.
  A <b>scion of the <i>Floating Basilica</i></b>, a depraved and seditious bastard collaborator seeking dominion over a world of lessers. They bare brands and chain lashes; for despite their high birth, one higher will always seek to abuse those beneath them.
  A <b>fungal infested wayfarer</b>, with bracket shelf like goiter upon their neck, and puffballs clustering within a rotting eye socket. They are joyous, for death can no longer claim them in any meaningful way. In time, they shall know this as little more than a new tragedy.
