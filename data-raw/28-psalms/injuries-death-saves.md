### Technology Level Considerations
- **Past Tech**: Traditional injuries (broken bones, lost limbs)
- **Future Tech**: May include cybernetic replacements or tech-based healing

## Campaign Implications

### Long-term Effects
- **Injury accumulation** makes veterans increasingly fragile
- **Permanent stat loss** affects equipment carrying capacity
- **Equipment restrictions** limit tactical options

### Risk vs Reward
- **High-risk scenarios** may cause more injuries
- **Valuable loot** may be worth risking injury
- **Fresh recruits** vs **experienced injured veterans** trade-offs
