# 28 Psalms: Feats & Flaws

## Rolling for Feats and Flaws
- Each warband member rolls one Flaw and one Feat during creation
- Roll D10 for each table

## Flaws (D10)

| Roll | Flaw | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Xeno | No other warband member will heal them for any reason |
| 2 | Too Many Teeth | Warband member suffers -2 to Presence |
| 3 | Dead Man Walking | Death Saves are always at least DR10 |
| 4 | Ratman | Must bring cheese with them everywhere |
| 5 | Crazed | If warband member fails a morale test, they attack nearest model (friend or foe) |
| 6 | Broken | Warband member suffers -1 to all tests |
| 7 | Chicken | Auto-fails all morale tests |
| 8 | Late | Do not set up warband member at start of Scenario. They turn up at start of Round 2 |
| 9 | Purge | Warband member will only use weapons with Burn keyword |
| 10 | Weak Bones | Warband member can only use Armor of value 1 or less |

### Special Flaw Interactions
- **Ratman + Cheese**: Must always carry cheese (automatic equipment)
- **Purge + Weapon Selection**: Limits weapon choices to Burn weapons only
- **Late + Deployment**: Changes setup timing for affected model

## Feats (D10)

| Roll | Feat | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Marine | If using weapon with Reload keyword, they reload for free |
| 2 | Zealous | Never fails morale checks, ignores rolls for morale |
| 3 | Unpainted | Looks like statue. Monsters ignore them until they attack the monster |
| 4 | Rogue | Deals 1D4 additional damage if either attacking or defending model is in shadow of terrain |
| 5 | TNT | Starts every Scenario with Black Powder Bomb or Space Grenade |
| 6 | Gambler | Can reroll dice but if they fail on second roll, result is considered Fumble |
| 7 | Mother of Crows | As action, summon crows to attack another model. Target takes 2 HP damage if they fail Agility test |
| 8 | Skulls | Carries skull at all times. Takes no Equipment slots, can be used as Makeshift Weapon |
| 9 | BiblioTech | Player can pick any Feat from any Forbidden Psalm game they own. [Reroll if don't own any] |
| 10 | Undead | Cannot be healed by potions, but immune to Disease, Bleeding, and Poison. Auto-passes Death Saves |

### Special Feat Interactions
- **Marine + Reload Weapons**: Eliminates reload movement penalty
- **TNT + Equipment**: Free explosive each Scenario (if slots available)
- **BiblioTech + Other Games**: Allows cross-game feat selection
- **Undead + Healing**: Changes healing mechanics significantly

## Spending XP
When a warband member has **5 XP** you can spend it to:
- **Improve ability by 1** (any stat, no maximum)
- **Remove injury**
- **Reroll Flaw** (gain new random Flaw to replace current)
- **Gain new Feat** (roll on table or pick if BiblioTech)

## Feat and Flaw Synergies

### Positive Combinations
- **Marine + High-tech ranged weapons**: Excellent with Pulse Rifle or other Reload weapons
- **Rogue + Urban scenarios**: Extra damage in terrain-heavy environments
- **Zealous + Dangerous tactics**: Can take risks without morale concerns
- **Undead + Attrition warfare**: Excellent survivability for long campaigns

### Problematic Combinations
- **Purge + Limited weapon access**: Very restrictive if Burn weapons unavailable
- **Ratman + Equipment management**: Must always reserve slot for cheese
- **Late + Time-sensitive scenarios**: May miss crucial early rounds
- **Xeno + Team healing**: Eliminates friendly healing support

## Technology Level Interactions

### Past Tech Synergies
- **TNT**: Gets Black Powder Bomb
- **Marine**: Works with Crossbow reloading
- **Rogue**: Benefits from medieval terrain (castle shadows, etc.)

### Future Tech Synergies
- **TNT**: Gets Space Grenade
- **Marine**: Excellent with Pulse Rifle, Plas-mar
- **BiblioTech**: Can access cyberpunk/sci-fi feats from other games

## Campaign Considerations
- **Flaws accumulate** through injury rolls
- **Feats can be gained** through XP spending or injury Criticals
- **BiblioTech** requires owning other Forbidden Psalm books
- **Undead** models have different healing/injury interactions throughout campaign
