# Forbidden Psalm: Injuries & Death Saves

## Death Saves
When a model is **Downed** at the end of a Scenario, they must make a **Death Save**.
- **Death Save**: Toughness test against **DR6**
- **On Failure or Fumble**: Model Dies
- **On Success**: Model is wounded and must roll an Injury (see table below)
- **On Critical**: Model learned something new - roll an Injury AND gain a new Feat

## Injury Table (D20)

| Roll | Injury | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Lasting Injury | Roll for new Flaw (in addition to existing Flaws). Reroll duplicates |

## Special Injury Sources

### Jumping/Falling
- **Failed jump**: 1 damage per inch dropped, rounded down
- **Fumbled jump**: 1 damage per inch dropped + gain random Injury

### Sock Stealing Goblin
- If successfully hit: make DR12 Presence test or gain **Broken Bone Injury** (can only be gained once from Goblins)

### Taming Morka-Porka
- To tame: feed it your flesh and make DR12 Presence test when within 1 inch
- On success: gain **Lost Limb Injury** but gain Morka-Porka as mount (+3 movement, gore attack D8)

### Magic Calamity
- Some Calamity Table results grant **Lost Limb Injury** (e.g., hostile arm)

## Injury Management

### Removing Injuries
Injuries are permanent and stack, but can be removed by:
- **Spending 5 XP** to remove one Injury
- **Better Grub** (Hogs Head Inn upgrade): +1 HP to counter Maimed injury
- **Tincture**: Cures Malaise injury specifically

### Injury Effects
- **Permanent**: Most injuries last forever unless specifically removed
- **Temporary**: Some last only "next Scenario" (Concussed, Sprained Ankle, Bruised Eye, Bruised Ribs, Afraid)
- **Stacking**: Multiple injuries can affect same model

## Death and Resurrection

### When Models Die
- Cannot participate in further Scenarios
- Drop all Equipment (can be redistributed)
- Count towards **Fresh Blood** recruitment
- **XP awarded**: Each death grants 1 XP to warband

### Resurrection Options
1. **Clean Scroll "Not Dead Yet"**: Dead model awakens with 1 HP and additional Flaw
2. **Ritual Circle** (Hogs Head Inn upgrade, 50 Gold):
   - Choose surviving member to perform ritual
   - They make Presence test
   - **Success**: Resurrected member replaces Flaw with new random Flaw
   - **Failure**: Performing model gets -1 Toughness
   - **Fumble**: Performing model dies
3. **5 XP spend**: Bring 1 warband member back from Dead with new Flaw (randomly rolled)

## Related Rules

### Fresh Blood Recruitment
- If warband has fewer than 5 members, recruit new ones for **free**
- New members come with no Equipment
- Create them as per normal warband creation rules

### Morale and Injuries
- Some injuries affect Morale (Afraid auto-fails next Scenario)
- Some Feats help with Morale (Medic can heal Downed models)
