# The Last War: Injuries & Death Saves

When a model is **Downed** at the end of a Scenario, they must make a **Death Save**.
- **Death Save**: Toughness test against **DR6**
- **On Failure**: Model Dies
- **On Success**: Model is wounded and must roll an Injury (see table below)
- **On Critical**: Model learned something new - roll an Injury AND gain a new Feat

## Special Death Save Interactions

### Loup-Garou Special Trooper
- **Auto-passes Death Saves** and **never gains Injuries**

### Nurse Nightshade Services
- Pay **15 Resources** to auto-pass a Death Save
- Pay **15 Resources** to remove 1 injury (can be done multiple times)

## Injury Management

### Removing Injuries
Injuries are permanent and stack, but can be removed by:
- **Spending 5 XP** to remove one Injury
- **Nurse Nightshade**: 15 Resources to remove 1 injury
- **Strength through Pain** (injury roll 18): +1 Toughness
- **What Doesn't Kill You** (injury roll 20): Remove one Flaw

### Temporary Effects
- Some injuries have conditional effects (Shell Shock, Chronic Pain, Breathing Problems)
- **Destined to Die**: Refuses next Scenario (temporary)

## Campaign Considerations

### Between Scenarios
1. Each surviving crew member gets **10 Resources**
2. Roll **Death Saves** for all Downed models
3. Roll **Injuries** for survivors who passed Death Saves
4. **Sell equipment** to Quartermaster (half price)
5. **Spend XP** (5 points for improvements)
6. **Recruit replacements** if needed

### XP Awards (1 XP each)
- **Hostile Killed**
- **Loot Collected**
- **Scenarios with at least 1 member surviving**
- **Models you Downed**
- **Death Saves passed**
- **Crew members who died**

### Fresh Blood Recruitment
- If crew has **fewer than 5 members**, recruit new ones for **free**
- New members come with **no Equipment**
- Create as per normal crew creation rules

## Combat Death Rules
- **Downed models** take no further actions
- **Additional damage** to Downed models kills them immediately
- **Face down** = Dead, **Face up** = Downed
- Models can be **dragged** by other crew members within 1 inch

## Medical Support

### Medic Special Trooper
- As action can **heal 1 model within 1 inch for 1D4 HP**
- Starts with **bandage**, **lead & opium**, and **bandolier**

## Mutation Interactions

- **Calamity Table**: Some results cause mutations
- **Unnatural Metabolism** mutation: Can heal 1D4 as action but eats Resources

## Death and Memorial
- **Wall of Remembrance**: Add names of dead crew members
- **Permanent loss**: Dead models cannot be resurrected (unlike Forbidden Psalm)
- **XP awarded**: Each death grants 1 XP to remaining crew
