## Game Overview

- **Health**: HP = 8 + Toughness, models become Downed at 0 HP, Dead if damaged further
- **Equipment Slots**: 5 + Strength slots for carrying gear
- **Magic System**: Any model can read Manuscripts, risk Calamities
- **Campaign Play**: XP system, injuries, death saves, and crew progression
- **Environmental Hazards**: The Fog causes mutations and limits visibility
