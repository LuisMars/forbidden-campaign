## Mutation Interactions

### Positive Synergies
- **Acid Blood + Thick Hide**: Defensive tank build
- **Multiple Eyes + Night Vision**: Excellent scout abilities
- **Regeneration + Unnatural Metabolism**: Self-sustaining healer

### Negative Combinations
- **Bioluminescence + Adaptive Camouflage**: Contradictory abilities
- **Distorted Vocal Cords + Well Read**: Cannot use Manuscripts
- **Psychic Sensitivity + Witch**: Takes damage from own spellcasting

## Environmental Factors

### The Fog
- **Primary source** of mutations in The Last War
- **Fog Tainted Special Trooper**: Starts with 1 random mutation
- **Prolonged exposure** may cause additional mutations (GM discretion)

### Calamity Table Mutations
From manuscript miscasting:
- **Roll 2**: Caster gains random mutation
- **Roll 15**: May turn into Mud Ghoul if Downed by damage

## Campaign Considerations

### Mutation Loss
- Rolling the **same mutation twice** removes it
- Represents body **adapting** or **rejecting** the change
- Allows for **character evolution** over time

### Social Impact
- Some mutations affect **Presence tests**
- **NPCs may react differently** to visibly mutated characters
- **Quartermaster** may charge more for heavily mutated crews

### Combat Applications
- Many mutations provide **combat advantages**
- Some create **defensive benefits**
- Others offer **utility functions**

## Medical Treatment
- **Lead & Opium**: Cures diseases but not mutations
- **Nurse Nightshade**: Can remove injuries but not mutations
- **Mutations are permanent** unless lost through duplicate rolling

## Role-Playing Guidelines
- Mutations should **change character behavior**
- **Physical descriptions** should reflect changes
- **Inter-crew dynamics** may shift based on mutations
- Some mutations may **limit equipment use** or **social interactions**
